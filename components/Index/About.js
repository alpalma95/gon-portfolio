            I am Gonzalo DÃ­az Cobacho, I am currently studying for a PhD in
            philosophy in which I am researching issues related to pluralism and
            the determination of death. In addition, I am interested in other
            topics where ethics can play a key role such as end-of-life issues,
            Artificial Intelligence, conscientious objection and problems with
            vaccination.

            I have a degree in Humanities from the University of Cadiz, a degree
            I finished in 2017. In addition, I hold a master&apos;s degree in
            Contemporary Philosophy from the University of Granada, which I
            finished in 2018. Complementarily, in 2019 I obtained a Diploma of
            Specialization in Bioethics by the Andalusian School of Public
            Health in which I researched on &quot;Pluralism in death&quot;. I
            have also received a research grant from the Grifols i Lucas
            Foundation and a research grant from the Banc Sabadell.
